# LS2 Test Specifications and Acceptance Criteria

## Overview

These test specifications are derived from the refined LS2 prompts and address all previous gaps: eliminating duplicate/inconsistent definitions, increasing test coverage, and specifying tests for real cross-platform, CPU-only logic. All modules are covered with TDD-compliant, comprehensive test cases and clear acceptance criteria.

- Input validation and type annotations
- Logging and exception reporting

### Test Cases

#### 1.1 Interface Consistency
- Test that only one `AudioIO` class exists and is importable.
- Test that all public methods have correct signatures and docstrings.

#### 1.2 Device Enumeration
- Test device listing returns expected structure on Linux, Windows, macOS.

- Test resource cleanup on exceptions during streaming.

#### 1.4 CPU-Only Compliance

#### 1.5 Error Handling
- Test exceptions are raised for invalid device, busy device, or permission errors.
- Test error messages are logged and user-friendly.

#### 1.6 Input Validation
- Test that invalid input types/values are rejected with clear errors.

### Acceptance Criteria
- All public methods are covered by at least one positive and one negative test.
- Tests pass on Linux, Windows, and macOS (mocked if needed).
- No duplicate or inconsistent interface definitions.
- All error paths are tested and produce clear, logged messages.
- 100% function coverage, ≥80% branch coverage.

## 2. `denoiser.py`

### Test Areas
- Canonical `DenoisingInference` interface (no duplicates)
- Model loading and unloading (CPU-only)
- Denoising inference logic (input/output shape, type, and value checks)
- Error handling (model not found, invalid input, etc.)
- Input validation and type annotations
- Logging and exception reporting

### Test Cases

#### 2.1 Interface Consistency
- Test that only one `DenoisingInference` class exists and is importable.
- Test that all public methods have correct signatures and docstrings.

#### 2.2 Model Loading

- Test error on missing, corrupt, or GPU-only model files.

#### 2.3 Inference Logic
- Test denoising on valid audio input (array, bytes, etc.).
- Test output shape/type matches input.
- Test edge cases: empty input, very large input, unsupported formats.

#### 2.4 CPU-Only Compliance
- Test that model runs on CPU and fails gracefully if GPU is required.

#### 2.5 Error Handling
- Test exceptions for invalid model, input, or inference errors.
- Test error messages are logged and user-friendly.

#### 2.6 Input Validation
- Test that invalid input types/values are rejected with clear errors.

### Acceptance Criteria
- All public methods are covered by at least one positive and one negative test.
- Model loading and inference are tested for both success and failure.
- No duplicate or inconsistent interface definitions.
- All error paths are tested and produce clear, logged messages.
- 100% function coverage, ≥80% branch coverage.

- Error handling (file not found, permission denied, etc.)
- Input validation and type annotations
- Logging and exception reporting

### Test Cases

#### 3.1 Interface Consistency
- Test that only one `DenoisingApp` class exists and is importable.
- Test that all public methods have correct signatures and docstrings.

#### 3.2 GUI Initialization
- Test GUI starts and closes without errors.
- Test resource cleanup on exit.

#### 3.3 User Actions
- Test file open/save dialogs with valid and invalid paths.
- Test start/stop denoising triggers correct backend calls.

#### 3.4 Error Handling
- Test exceptions for file errors, permission errors, and backend failures.
