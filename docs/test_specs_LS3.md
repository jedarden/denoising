# LS3 Test Specifications & Acceptance Criteria

This document defines the comprehensive test specifications and acceptance criteria for LS3, covering all modules: [`audio_io.py`](audio_io.py:1), [`denoiser.py`](denoiser.py:1), [`gui.py`](gui.py:1), [`main.py`](main.py:1), and [`model_utils.py`](model_utils.py:1).

## 1. `audio_io.py`

### Test Specifications

- **Device Enumeration**
  - Should enumerate real audio input/output devices (not stubs).
  - Should raise and log errors if device enumeration fails.
  - Should return a list of device dicts with required fields (`id`, `name`).
  - Should enforce CPU-only/platform compliance (no GPU code).
  - Should validate all method inputs (e.g., callback is callable).

- **Stream Management**
  - Should start and stop audio streams with valid callbacks.
  - Should raise and log errors for invalid callbacks or device parameters.
  - Should handle device access failures gracefully.
  - Should enforce cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).

- **Input Validation**
  - Should raise `TypeError` or `ValueError` for invalid input types/values.
  - Should provide user-friendly error messages for invalid parameters.

### Acceptance Criteria

- All public methods have robust input validation and error handling.
- All errors are logged and user-friendly.
- No GPU-specific or platform-incompatible code is present.
- Device and stream management logic is real and not stubbed.
- Coverage ≥ 70%.

## 2. `denoiser.py`

### Test Specifications

- **Model Loading**
  - Should load a real denoising model (not a stub).
  - Should raise and log errors for missing/invalid model files.
  - Should enforce CPU-only operation (no GPU code).
  - Should validate all input parameters for model loading.

- **Inference**
  - Should process audio buffers using the loaded model.
  - Should raise and log errors for invalid audio buffers.
  - Should validate input types and buffer shapes.
  - Should handle inference errors gracefully.

- **Platform/CPU Enforcement**
  - Should check and enforce CPU-only execution paths.
  - Should be platform-agnostic.

### Acceptance Criteria

- All public methods validate inputs and handle errors robustly.
- All exceptions are logged with clear messages.
- No GPU or platform-specific code is present.
- Model loading and inference are real and functional.
- Coverage ≥ 70%.

## 3. `gui.py`

### Test Specifications

- **Interface Consistency**
  - All public methods are defined once with consistent signatures.
  - No duplicate or inconsistent method definitions.

- **GUI Logic**
  - Should implement real status updates and event handling.
  - Should handle all user actions and GUI events with try/except blocks.
  - Should provide user feedback for invalid input.

- **Input Validation**
  - Should validate all user and API inputs.
  - Should raise and display user-friendly errors for invalid entries.

### Acceptance Criteria

- All public methods are unique and consistent.
- All user actions and events are handled with robust error handling.
- All user inputs are validated and feedback is provided.
- GUI logic is real and not stubbed.
- Coverage ≥ 70%.

## 4. `main.py`

### Test Specifications

- **Startup/Shutdown Logic**
  - Should implement real application startup and shutdown logic.
  - Should handle and log errors during initialization and shutdown.
  - Should validate all configuration and command-line arguments.

- **Error Handling**
  - Should provide user-friendly error messages for all failure paths.
  - Should log all exceptions with context.

- **Integration**
  - Should integrate with all other modules and handle their errors gracefully.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Application starts and shuts down with real logic.
- All configuration and CLI inputs are validated.
- All errors are logged and user-friendly.
- All module integrations are tested.
- Coverage ≥ 70%.

## 5. `model_utils.py`

### Test Specifications

- **Model Selection & Conversion**
  - Should implement real logic for model selection, quantization, and ONNX export.
  - Should raise and log errors for unsupported models or conversion failures.
  - Should remove duplicate/inconsistent method definitions.

- **Input Validation**
  - Should validate all input types and values for public methods.
  - Should raise `ValueError` for unsupported models.

- **Error Handling**
  - Should log all exceptions with clear messages.
  - Should enforce CPU-only and platform-agnostic logic.

### Acceptance Criteria

- All public methods are unique and consistent.
- All inputs are validated and errors are logged.
- Model selection, quantization, and ONNX export are real and functional.
- No GPU or platform-specific code is present.
- Coverage ≥ 70%.

## General Integration & Completeness

### Test Specifications

- **Module Integration**
  - All modules interact as expected (e.g., `main.py` uses `audio_io`, `denoiser`, `gui`, and `model_utils`).
  - Errors in one module are propagated and handled gracefully in others.
  - All public APIs are callable and tested.

- **Regression**
  - Adding new features or refactoring does not break existing functionality.

### Acceptance Criteria

- All modules are fully integrated and tested together.
- No regressions are introduced by new changes.
- All acceptance criteria above are met for each module.
