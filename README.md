# Denoising Toolkit

A modular, research-driven Python toolkit for audio denoising, featuring a cross-platform GUI, robust model utilities, and comprehensive test coverage. Designed for rapid experimentation, reproducibility, and extensibility in speech and audio enhancement tasks.

## üöÄ Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/denoising.git
   cd denoising
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install all dependencies (including ONNX Runtime):**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   > **Note:** ONNX Runtime (`onnxruntime`) is required for model inference. If you encounter issues installing it, refer to the [ONNX Runtime installation guide](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/).

   - **Platform-specific requirements for Virtual Microphone:**
     - The Virtual Microphone feature is only supported on **Windows 10+** and **macOS 12+**.
     - On first use, you may be prompted for admin/system permissions to install a virtual audio device or system extension.
     - No manual installation of third-party tools is required; all components are bundled or installed programmatically.
     - **Linux is not currently supported for the virtual microphone.**

4. **Run the application:**
   - **GUI:**
     You can run the GUI application in either of the following ways:
     - As a module (recommended, ensures correct imports):
       ```bash
       python -m src.main
       ```
     - Or, by setting the `PYTHONPATH` so Python treats `src/` as a package:
       ```bash
       PYTHONPATH=. python src/main.py
       ```
     > **Note:** Directly running `python src/main.py` without setting `PYTHONPATH` will result in an import error due to Python's package import rules. Using the `-m` flag or setting `PYTHONPATH` ensures absolute imports work correctly.
   - **Command-line (example):**
     ```bash
     python src/denoiser.py --input noisy.wav --output clean.wav
     ```

5. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

## üì¶ Installation

- **Python 3.8+ required**
- Recommended: Use a virtual environment (`.venv`)
- Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- For development, install test and linting tools:
  ```bash
  pip install pytest coverage mypy flake8
  ```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### GUI

- Launch with `python src/main.py`
- Intuitive interface for loading, denoising, and saving audio files
- Visualize waveforms and denoising results

### Command-Line

- Denoise audio:
  ```bash
  python src/denoiser.py --input noisy.wav --output clean.wav
  ```
- See all options:
  ```bash
  python src/denoiser.py --help
  ```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** All modules are covered by unit tests. Write tests before implementing new features.
- **Modular Design:** Each module has a single responsibility. Extend functionality by adding new modules and tests.
- **Continuous Integration:** Use `pytest` and `coverage` to ensure code quality.
- **Documentation:** Update `README.md` and module docstrings for all changes.

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
coverage run -m pytest tests/
coverage report
```

### Linting & Type Checking

```bash
flake8 src/ tests/
mypy src/
```

## üß™ Troubleshooting

- **Import errors:** Ensure your virtual environment is activated and all dependencies (including `onnxruntime`) are installed.
- **ONNX Runtime not found:**
  If you see errors like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'onnxruntime'`, run:
  ```bash
  pip install onnxruntime
  ```
  For platform-specific wheels or issues, see the [ONNX Runtime installation guide](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/).

- **"VirtualMicrophoneService is not defined" or NotImplementedError:**
  - This error occurs if you attempt to use the Virtual Microphone feature on an unsupported platform (e.g., Linux) or if the backend is not yet implemented for your OS.
  - The Virtual Microphone is only available on Windows 10+ and macOS 12+.
  - If you see `NotImplementedError: Virtual microphone is only supported on Windows and macOS.` or `NotImplementedError: <platform> virtual microphone backend not yet implemented.`, this is expected on unsupported platforms or while the feature is in beta.

- **Audio file issues:** Supported formats are WAV/PCM. For others, convert using `ffmpeg`.
- **GUI not launching:** Check for missing GUI dependencies (e.g., PyQt5, Tkinter).
- **Test failures:** Run `pytest -v` for detailed output. Check for missing test dependencies.
- **Permission errors:** Avoid running as root. Ensure you have read/write access to audio files.

## üé§ Virtual Microphone Feature (Beta)

The Denoising Toolkit includes a **Virtual Microphone** feature, allowing denoised audio to be routed to a system-level virtual audio input device. This enables you to use denoised audio in real-time with third-party applications (e.g., Zoom, Teams, Discord).

### Supported Platforms

- **Windows 10+** (user-mode virtual audio device, no manual driver install required)
- **macOS 12+** (CoreAudio virtual device, no manual third-party tools required)
- **Linux is not supported** (feature will raise `NotImplementedError`)

### How It Works

- When you run the GUI or main application, a virtual microphone device is created and registered with your OS (if supported).
- Denoised audio is streamed to this device in real time.
- In your communication app, select "Denoising Virtual Microphone" (or similar) as your input device.

### Usage

1. **Run the application as usual:**
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
2. **Select the virtual microphone in your target app's audio settings.**
3. **Denoised audio will be routed automatically.**

### Permissions & Security

- On first use, you may be prompted for admin/system permissions to install a virtual audio device or system extension.
- No manual installation of third-party tools is required; all components are bundled or installed programmatically.

### Troubleshooting

- If the virtual microphone does not appear:
  - Ensure you have granted all required permissions.
  - Restart your system if prompted after installation.
  - Check the application logs for errors related to the virtual microphone.
- If you encounter issues, disable the feature by running with the `--no-virtual-mic` flag (if available).
- If you see `NotImplementedError` related to the virtual microphone, check your OS support (see above).

### Limitations

- The feature is in beta; some advanced audio routing scenarios may not be supported.
- Only one instance of the virtual microphone is supported at a time.
- The backend implementation for Windows and macOS is in progress; you may see `NotImplementedError` until full support is released.
