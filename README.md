---

## üöÄ Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/denoising.git
   cd denoising
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install all dependencies (including ONNX Runtime):**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   > **Note:** ONNX Runtime (`onnxruntime`) is required for model inference.
   > If you encounter issues installing it, see [ONNX Runtime: Installation & Troubleshooting](#onnx-runtime-installation--troubleshooting) below for detailed, platform-specific help.

   - **Platform-specific requirements for Virtual Microphone:**
     - The Virtual Microphone feature is only supported on **Windows 10+** and **macOS 12+**.
     - On first use, you may be prompted for admin/system permissions to install a virtual audio device or system extension.
     - No manual installation of third-party tools is required; all components are bundled or installed programmatically.
     - **Linux is not currently supported for the virtual microphone.**

4. **Run the application:**
   - **GUI:**
     You can run the GUI application in either of the following ways:
     - As a module (recommended, ensures correct imports):
       ```bash
       python -m src.main
       ```
     - Or, by setting the `PYTHONPATH` so Python treats `src/` as a package:
       ```bash
       PYTHONPATH=. python src/main.py
       ```
     > **Note:** Directly running `python src/main.py` without setting `PYTHONPATH` will result in an import error due to Python's package import rules. Using the `-m` flag or setting `PYTHONPATH` ensures absolute imports work correctly.
   - **Command-line (example):**
     ```bash
     python src/denoiser.py --input noisy.wav --output clean.wav
     ```

5. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

## üß™ Troubleshooting

- **Import errors:** Ensure your virtual environment is activated and all dependencies (including `onnxruntime`) are installed.
- **ONNX Runtime not found:**
  If you see errors like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'onnxruntime'`, run:
  ```bash
  pip install onnxruntime
  ```
  For platform-specific wheels or issues, see the [ONNX Runtime installation guide](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/).

- **"VirtualMicrophoneService is not defined" or NotImplementedError:**
  - This error occurs if you attempt to use the Virtual Microphone feature on an unsupported platform (e.g., Linux) or if the backend is not yet implemented for your OS.
  - The Virtual Microphone is only available on Windows 10+ and macOS 12+.
  - If you see `NotImplementedError: Virtual microphone is only supported on Windows and macOS.` or `NotImplementedError: <platform> virtual microphone backend not yet implemented.`, this is expected on unsupported platforms or while the feature is in beta.

- **Audio file issues:** Supported formats are WAV/PCM. For others, convert using `ffmpeg`.
- **GUI not launching:** Check for missing GUI dependencies (e.g., PyQt5, Tkinter).
- **Test failures:** Run `pytest -v` for detailed output. Check for missing test dependencies.
- **Permission errors:** Avoid running as root. Ensure you have read/write access to audio files.

## üé§ Virtual Microphone Feature (Beta)

The Denoising Toolkit includes a **Virtual Microphone** feature, allowing denoised audio to be routed to a system-level virtual audio input device. This enables you to use denoised audio in real-time with third-party applications (e.g., Zoom, Teams, Discord).

### Supported Platforms

- **Windows 10+** (user-mode virtual audio device, no manual driver install required)
- **macOS 12+** (CoreAudio virtual device, no manual third-party tools required)
- **Linux is not supported** (feature will raise `NotImplementedError`)

### How It Works

- When you run the GUI or main application, a virtual microphone device is created and registered with your OS (if supported).
- Denoised audio is streamed to this device in real time.
- In your communication app, select "Denoising Virtual Microphone" (or similar) as your input device.

### Usage

1. **Run the application as usual:**
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
2. **Select the virtual microphone in your target app's audio settings.**
3. **Denoised audio will be routed automatically.**

### Permissions & Security

- On first use, you may be prompted for admin/system permissions to install a virtual audio device or system extension.
- No manual installation of third-party tools is required; all components are bundled or installed programmatically.

### Troubleshooting

- If the virtual microphone does not appear:
  - Ensure you have granted all required permissions.
  - Restart your system if prompted after installation.
  - Check the application logs for errors related to the virtual microphone.
- If you encounter issues, disable the feature by running with the `--no-virtual-mic` flag (if available).
- If you see `NotImplementedError` related to the virtual microphone, check your OS support (see above).

### Limitations

- The feature is in beta; some advanced audio routing scenarios may not be supported.
- Only one instance of the virtual microphone is supported at a time.
- The backend implementation for Windows and macOS is in progress; you may see `NotImplementedError` until full support is released.

## üîä Virtual Microphone: Troubleshooting "Failed to initialize VirtualMicrophoneService"

If you encounter the error message:

```
Failed to initialize VirtualMicrophoneService
```

in the application logs or console output, it means the virtual microphone feature could not be started. This feature is currently **beta** and only supported on **Windows 10+** and **macOS 12+**. Linux is not supported.

### Common Causes

- **Missing dependencies**: Required system libraries or drivers are not installed.
- **Insufficient permissions**: The application lacks admin or system-level permissions to install or access virtual audio devices.
- **Platform limitations**: The feature is not available on your OS version or hardware.
- **Incomplete installation**: The virtual audio driver or system extension was not installed correctly, or the installation was interrupted.
- **Antivirus or security software**: Security tools may block driver installation or access.

### How to Resolve

#### Windows

1. **Run as Administrator**  
   Right-click the application or your terminal and select "Run as administrator" to grant necessary permissions.

2. **Check for Driver Prompts**  
   On first use, Windows may prompt you to allow installation of a virtual audio device. Accept all prompts.

3. **Verify Driver Installation**  
   - Open Device Manager and look for a "Virtual Audio Device" under "Sound, video and game controllers".
   - If missing, restart the application as administrator.

4. **Temporarily Disable Antivirus/Security Software**  
   Some security tools may block driver installation. Temporarily disable them and try again.

5. **Check Windows Version**  
   Ensure you are running Windows 10 or newer.

6. **Review Log Output**  
   Check the application logs for lines containing `VirtualMicrophoneService` for more details.

#### macOS

1. **Grant Microphone and System Extension Permissions**  
   - On first use, macOS may prompt for microphone access and to allow a system extension.
   - Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and approve any pending requests for the app or virtual audio device.

2. **Restart After Granting Permissions**  
   After approving permissions or system extensions, restart your Mac and the application.

3. **Check macOS Version**  
   Ensure you are running macOS 12 (Monterey) or newer.

4. **Review Log Output**  
   Look for lines containing `VirtualMicrophoneService` in the application logs for more details.

5. **Check for Third-Party Conflicts**  
   Audio routing tools (e.g., Loopback, BlackHole) may interfere. Try disabling them temporarily.

### Beta Status and Limitations

- The virtual microphone feature is **beta** and may not work on all systems.
- Only one virtual microphone instance can be active at a time.
- Some hardware configurations or enterprise-managed devices may block virtual audio drivers.
- If you continue to experience issues, please report them with your OS version and relevant log output.
